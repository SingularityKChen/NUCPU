AXI-64bit
This file includes two parts:AXI4 and AXI4Timer.
AXI4 module is AXI_rw module. It provides a axi4 (read and write) interface between the CPU and crossbar.
AXI4Timer module works for CLINT(Timer interrupt).
Because the DMA part is not necessary, the first edition of AXI4Timer is an individual part. It is not a AXI4 Slave module.
On the other hand, the second edition of AXI4Timer can be an AXI4 slave module.
